Grouped based on shared characteristics present in more than one [[species]]. Length of the branches does not give any time scale.

All [[species]] branching from a node share that common ancestor.
[[species]] descending from a common ancestor will have the traits it had.
The more recently two [[species]] branched apart, the more closely related they are.
