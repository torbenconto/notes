#definition 
typically end in -ase
speed up chemical reactions

Substrate
	Reactant that is changed by the enzyme

Active Site
	Where the Substrate binds.
	Matches the shape and chemical properties of the Substrate.

Enzyme-substrate Complex
	When the Enzyme and Substrate are bonded together.

- Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in the body. 
- They are re-usable and not used up during a reaction. 
- The shape and chemical properties of an Enzyme is specific to it's substrate. 
- Enzymes are made of proteins.

Induced fit model
	When the substrate binds, the enzyme changes shape and surrounds the substrate to catalyze and speed up the chemical reaction.
	It then returns to it's original shape in order to catalyze the next substrate.
