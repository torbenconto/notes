#definition 
Diffusion of water across a membrane from high water concentration to low water concentration. Reverse osmosis occurs when pressure is added and the water is forced to go in the opposite direction.

Determine the tonicity of the solution in a cell by comparing the extracellular solute concentration to the intracellular solute concentration.

Three types of solutions 
- Hypertonic
	- More stuff, less water outside the cell, water will move out of the cell.
- Hypotonic
	- Less stuff, more water outside the cell, water will move into the cell.
- Isotonic
	- Same water out and inside the cell. No net movement of water because the cell is at dynamic equilibrium.
## Water movement
Moves from high concentration of water to low concentration of water (water potential). low solute to high solute. low osmolarity to high osmolarity. 

## In plants
Water has to move through the [[Cell wall]] and [[Cell membrane]] in plants. Water is stored in large [[Vacuole]]s that exert turgor pressure on the [[Cell wall]]. Limits how much water can be stored in the cell.
- Hypotonic - Turgid (max pressure of water)
- Isotonic - Flaccid (wilted plant)
- Hypertonic - Plasmolyzed (extreme wilted)

## Plasmolysis
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmolysis)
Plasmolysis is the process in which cells lose water in a hypertonic solution. The reverse process, deplasmolysis or cytolysis, can occur if the cell is in a hypotonic solution resulting in a lower external osmotic pressure and a net flow of water into the cell.

## Cytolysis
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytolysis)
Cytolysis, or osmotic lysis, occurs when a cell bursts due to an osmotic imbalance that has caused excess water to diffuse into the cell.
## Water Potential Equation
Allows for quantification of water potential on both sides of the membrane.
Water potential of distilled water is always 0.
Pressure potential is how much pressure is being exerted on the cell or solution. For AP Bio they always set this to 0 unless they tell you otherwise.
Solute potential is the amount of solute in a solution. Given as a negative value because adding solutes to a solution always decreases the total water potential.
Dependent on two values
- Pressure potential
- Solute potential
Calculating solute potential
Ψs = – iCRT
i = the number of ions the solute breaks into when put in water. Only ionic bonds break.
C = molecular concentration
R = 0.0831
T = temperature in kelvin
Covalently bonded molecules will have an i value of 1 because they do not ionize in water.
Ionically bonded molecules will have an i value equal to the number of ions the compound breaks into.
Gives us a quantified way to determine which way water will move.
```
water Potential (Ψ)
Ψ = Ψp + Ψs
Ψp = pressure potential
Ψs = solute potential
The water potential will be equal to the
solute potential of a solution in an open
container, since the pressure potential
of the solution in an open container is
zero.
the Solute Potential of the Solution
Ψs = – iCRT
i = ionization constant (For sucrose
this is 1.0 because sucrose does not
ionize in water.)
C = molar concentration
R = pressure constant (R = 0.0831 liter
bars/mole K)
T = temperature in Kelvin (273 + ºC)
```
## Osmoregulation
Maintains water balance and allows organisms to control their internal solute composition/ water potential. Maintained through osmosis and adjusting
