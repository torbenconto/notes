#definition 
Hydrophilic ligands bind to a receptor that is embedded in the cell membrane. The ligand does not cross the membrane. Signal is amplified and moved from the membrane to the nucleus.

Require use of transduction to move the signal from the membrane to the nucleus.
Ligand binds to the receptor, causing it to change shape. This transmits the signal into the cell.
A second messenger is activated and phosphorylates the next protein in the chain to activate it. 
This occurs over and over until the last protein in the pathway (usually a transcription factor) enters the nucleus and initiates the cell response.
