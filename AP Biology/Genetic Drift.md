Non-selective change in [[allele]] frequency in a population due to random chance events that equally effect all members of the population regardless of their traits. Lowers genetic diversity and makes survivability more difficult

## Founder Effect
When a small group of an existing population leaves to colonize a new area an exclusively breed with members of this population.

If the [[allele]]s for rare, recessive traits are present in high frequency in the new population, there can be a higher change of these diseases.

## Bottleneck
Where a natural disaster kills off most of the population, leaving few survivors behind.
