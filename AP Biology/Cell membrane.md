 #definition
A [[phospholipid]] bi-layer which surrounds the entire cell. Regulates what comes into and out of the cell and protects the interior from intercellular space.

Surrounds the cells of all living organisms. It is responsible for controlling what enters and exits the cell. Also contains [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, and [[cholesterol]]. Also known as the plasma membrane.

#### Selective Permeability
Membrane only lets small, non-polar molecules diffuse freely through the spaces between the phospholipids.
- Oxygen
- Carbon Dioxide
- Water
Why?
It is energetically unfavorable for those molecules with those properties to interact with the hydrophobic tails at the core of the membrane.

## Importance of Transport
- Transport waste out of the cell
	- Helps maintain pH and salt balance
- Transport signal proteins out of the cell
- Absorption of nutrients
- Allows oxygen into the cell for cellular respiration
- Allows C02 to leave the cell
- Assists in [[apoptosis]]
