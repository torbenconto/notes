The process by which sexually reproducing organisms produce genetically diverse [[haploid]] [[gamete]]s.

# Steps
## Meiosis I
[[Interphase]]
### Prophase I
Where crossing over occurs (see [[chromosome]])
### Metaphase I
Homologous Chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell.
### Anaphase I
Homologous Chromosomes are pulled toward the poles of the cell.
### Telophase & Cytokinesis I
Cell divides into two.
## Interkinesis
Nap time
## Meiosis II
### Prophase II
No crossing over this time
### Steps are repeated again
Homologous Chromosomes are referred to as sister chromatids when in Meiosis II
# End Result of Meiosis II
Four genetically diverse cells.

# Mutations
Mutations occur in [[gamete]]s and are passed down to offspring, leading to genetic disease.

The only way to pass down a mutation to offspring is if it occurs in a [[gamete]] that is used in fertilization.

Are very severe because they effect sections of genes or entire [[chromosome]].

Five types of chromosomal mutations that are caused by errors when crossing over.
- Deletion
	Where an entire section of a [[chromosome]] is missing.
- Duplication
	When one section of a [[chromosome]] is doubled.
- Inversion
	When one section of a [[chromosome]] has it's gene sequence reversed.
- Insertion
	Part of one [[chromosome]] is inserted into another [[chromosome]].
- Translocation
	Two non-homologous [[chromosome]]s go through crossing over and exchange alleles. 

## Nondisjunction
A type of mutation that occurs when homologous [[chromosome]]s do not separate properly during meiosis.
Results in [[gamete]]s with incorrect numbers of [[chromosome]]s.

More dangerous in Meiosis I because it will effect all 4 daughter cells.
