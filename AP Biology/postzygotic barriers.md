Reproductive barriers that occur after fertilization, preventing formation of offspring.

3 Barriers:
- Reduce hybrid viability
	Negative interactions between [[gene]]s of the two parent [[species]] causes offspring to be frail and unable to mate.
- Reduce hybrid fertility
	Hybrid offspring are viable, but infertile and cannot produce their own offspring. This is usually caused by different [[chromosome]] counts in parental [[gamete]]s.
- Hybrid breakdown
	The first generation are viable and fertile, but the offspring of the next generations are non-viable or infertile.
