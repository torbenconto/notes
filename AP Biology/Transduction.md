Signal is moved from the cell membrane to the nucleus through [[phosphorylation]] of a series of proteins. 

Ligand binds to the receptor, causing it to change shape. This transmits the signal into the cell.
A second messenger is activated and phosphorylates the next protein in the chain to activate it. 
This occurs over and over until the last protein in the pathway (usually a transcription factor) enters the nucleus and initiates the cell response.
