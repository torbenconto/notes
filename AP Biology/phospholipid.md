#definition 
Head group
contains phosphate choline and glycerol
- Polar
- Hydrophilic

Tail group
Fatty acid tail. Contains a saturated and unsaturated fatty acid. The unsaturated fatty acid is bent which prevents phospholipids from packing too tightly together and allows for membrane fluidity.

- Non-Polar
- Hydrophobic

It is energetically unfavorable for the hydrophobic tails to be exposed to the water.
This drives the formation of the phospholipid bi-layer
- hydrophilic head groups face the cell interior. 
- hydrophobic tail groups face the exterior
