Process used to create a [[DNA]] fingerprint.

Take different samples of [[DNA]] and expose them to the same restriction [[enzyme]].

This creates Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms.

You take these fragments of different lengths and place them into auger gel.

Turn on the electricity and it will separate them by length/size.

The larger pieces move slower so they will be closer.

You then stain the gel to see the [[DNA]] fragments.

You now have a unique fingerprint of an individual's [[DNA]].

1 in 70 trillion chance of an identical copy unless you are an identical twin.
