Deoxyribonucleic Acid

"Cellular ID Card"

Contains instructions for organism traits.
Stores heritable information to transmit to future generation.
Resides in the nucleus.

DNA Polymerase puts together DNA with monomers.

Double stranded helix structure
- Linear in Eukaryotes
- Circular in Prokaryotes
Composed of nucleotide monomers.
5' to 3' directionality for each strand. 5' matches up with 3'.
5' = phosphate at the end.
3' = OH group at the end.
Can only build on the 3' end.
Strands are parallel and bonded together with hydrogen bonds.

## Nucleotides
Monomers of DNA
Composed of three chemical groups
- 5 carbon deoxyribose sugar
- Phosphate
	Attached to the 5' end of DNA
- One of 4 nitrogenous bases

## Base pairing rules
Purines (double ring)
- Guanine
- Adenine
Pyrimidines (single ring)
- Cytosine
- Thymine

A always pairs with T
forms 2 H-bonds, easier to break

C always pairs with G
forms 3 H-bonds, takes more energy to break,
so areas of high CG base pairing require more energy to break during DNA replication

## Storage
Prokaryotic DNA is "naked" and stored in the [[Cytoplasm]] as a single* free-floating "circular" chromosome.

Eukaryotic DNA is wound around histone proteins and stored in the nucleus.

Both can contain small circular extrachromosomal DNA molecules called plasmids.

### Telomeres
Eukaryotic DNA has ends
- Prokaryotic doesent have this because it is circular
These ends degrade over time, leading to gene loss.
Eukaryotes have caps of long nonsense DNA called telomeres to protect against DNA degradation.

Helicase unwinds DNA
Ligase helps with something idk

## DNA replication

Step 1: Initiation
	- Topoisomerase relaxes the supercoiled DNA
	- DNA helicase breaks the hydrogen bonds between  the two strands
	- Strands are kept from re-binding by single stranded binding proteins
Step 2: Elongation
	- Primase puts down [[RNA]] primers to help DNA polymerase actually bind to the template DNA strand.
	- DNA Polymerase binds and synthesizes new strands from 5' to 3'
	- Lagging strand is broken up into fragments
	- Leading strand is continuous
		Primase adds a primer across from the 3' end on the outside of the replication fork
		DNA polymerase easily binds and replicates the new strand in one go. There are no gaps
		This is called continuous replication.
Step 3: Termination
	- [[RNA]] primers are removed
	- DNA ligase fills in the gaps from the primer removal and between the fragments
	- The end result is two identical copies of the DNA

### DNA Replication Timing
DNA replication occurs during the "S" phase of the cell cycle.

### Semi-conservative Replication
Each copy of the DNA will have one template (old) strand and one newly synthesized strand
