Process in which [[Ribosome]]s and t[[RNA]] synthesize the amino acid sequence coded for in the m[[RNA]]

Step 1: Initiation
Large and small subunit of the [[Ribosome]] bind to the start codon.

The small ribosomal subunit binds to the m[[RNA]].

Step 2: Elongation
The [[Ribosome]] reads the m[[RNA]] in sequences of 3 nucleotides called codons.

[[Ribosome]] trans locates to codon. At each codon the matching t[[RNA]] is 

Step 3: Termination
[[Ribosome]] continues translating until it reaches the stop codon.

Translation of the stop codon results in a release factor [[protein]] binding to the [[Ribosome]], causing it to release both the m[[RNA]] and the newly synthesized polypeptide.

## Prokaryote
Prokaryotes couple [[transcription]] and translation
Which means prokaryotic m[[RNA]] is translated as it is inscribed.

## Eukaryote
Eukaryotic [[transcription]] and translation are separated because eukaryotes have [[Nucleus]].
