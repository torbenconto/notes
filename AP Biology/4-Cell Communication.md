# Cell Signaling
A series of steps that allows cells to respond to signals from their environment. Cells will respond by initiating some sort of cellular activity. Signaling usually requires the secretion of ligand ( a chemical signal ) from the initiating cell to travel to the target cell. Only cells that have the correct receptor protein will respond to this signal molecule.

3 steps
- Reception
	Ligand binds to the receptor. Receptor undergoes a confirmational (shape) change. The shape change transmits signal inside of the cell.
- [[Transduction]] !!! IMPORTANT
	Signal is moved from the cell membrane to the nucleus through [[phosphorylation]] of a series of proteins. 
- Response
	Final molecule in the signal pathway initiates transcription of target genes in the nucleus. This leads to a protein being made which causes the cell response.

## 2 mechanisms of ligand delivery

### Cell to Cell contact
FASTEST METHOD
Cells make physical contact to transmit and initiate cell response. Requires direct contact between signal and receptor proteins bound on the cell membrane of communicating cells.

#### Gap junctions
occur in animal cells. 
Cell membranes fuse together.

#### Plasmodesmata
occur in plant cells
Channels that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells through small pores in their cell walls



### Paracrine signaling
Cell releases a signal molecule (ligand) that 

Ligands can travel short distances through diffusion or long distances through the bloodstream.

# Receptor Proteins

## [[Membrane Bound Receptors]]
## [[Intracellular Receptors]]



# How do cells respond to [[Transduction]]
Cells use signaling to respond to their environment.
Transduction pathways initiate transcription of target genes. This results in proteins being made that cause the cell to respond properly to the signal.

Examples of cell responses
- Imitation of gene expression ( making of proteins )
- Causing the cell to grow and enter the cell cycle
- Initiate [[apoptosis]]

# Structure, Function, and Pathway Malfunction
Mutations that lead to a change in shape and chemical affinity in signaling molecules, receptor molecules, or and of the proteins involved in [[Transduction]] can change or stop response from occurring properly.

# Feedback Mechanisms
Sensory pathways and responses that the body uses to maintain homeostasis.

Two types
- Negative Feedback
	Slows or stops a response
	Stopping the response causes the body system to return to it's normal state, this re-establishing homeostasis.
- Positive Feedback
	Amplifies or increases a response
	Used to produce large systematic changes to re-establish homeostasis
	Responsible for initiating and amplifying biological processes in the body.


# [[DNA]]

# Central dogma of biology
Describes the flow of information in a cell.
[[DNA]] transcripted to [[RNA]] which is the translated to [[protein]]s which create traits which create you.
Proteins carry out cell functions, which are expressed as a physical trait.
