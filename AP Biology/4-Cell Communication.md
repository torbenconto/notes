# Cell Signaling
A series of steps that allows cells to respond to signals from their environment. Cells will respond by initiating some sort of cellular activity. Signaling usually requires the secretion of ligand ( a chemical signal ) from the initiating cell to travel to the target cell. Only cells that have the correct receptor protein will respond to this signal molecule.

3 steps
- Reception
	Ligand binds to the receptor. Receptor undergoes a confirmational (shape) change. The shape change transmits signal inside of the cell.
- [[Transduction]] !!! IMPORTANT
	Signal is moved from the cell membrane to the [[Nucleus]] through [[phosphorylation]] of a series of proteins. 
- Response
	Final molecule in the signal pathway initiates transcription of target genes in the [[Nucleus]]. This leads to a protein being made which causes the cell response.

## 2 mechanisms of ligand delivery

### Cell to Cell contact
FASTEST METHOD
Cells make physical contact to transmit and initiate cell response. Requires direct contact between signal and receptor proteins bound on the cell membrane of communicating cells.

#### Gap junctions
occur in animal cells. 
Cell membranes fuse together.

#### Plasmodesmata
occur in plant cells
Channels that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells through small pores in their cell walls



### Paracrine signaling
Cell releases a signal molecule (ligand) that 

Ligands can travel short distances through diffusion or long distances through the bloodstream.

# Receptor Proteins

## [[Membrane Bound Receptors]]
## [[Intracellular Receptors]]



# How do cells respond to [[Transduction]]
Cells use signaling to respond to their environment.
Transduction pathways initiate transcription of target genes. This results in proteins being made that cause the cell to respond properly to the signal.

Examples of cell responses
- Imitation of gene expression ( making of proteins )
- Causing the cell to grow and enter the cell cycle
- Initiate [[apoptosis]]

# Structure, Function, and Pathway Malfunction
Mutations that lead to a change in shape and chemical affinity in signaling molecules, receptor molecules, or and of the proteins involved in [[Transduction]] can change or stop response from occurring properly.

# Feedback Mechanisms
Sensory pathways and responses that the body uses to maintain homeostasis.

Two types
- Negative Feedback
	Slows or stops a response
	Stopping the response causes the body system to return to it's normal state, this re-establishing homeostasis.
- Positive Feedback
	Amplifies or increases a response
	Used to produce large systematic changes to re-establish homeostasis
	Responsible for initiating and amplifying biological processes in the body.


# [[DNA]]

# Central dogma of biology
Describes the flow of information in a cell.
[[DNA]] transcripted to [[RNA]] which is the translated to [[protein]]s which create traits which create you.
Proteins carry out cell functions, which are expressed as a physical trait.

# Cell Cycle
Most cells in an organism are in the G0 or GNULL phase which means they are not going through the cell cycle.
![Cell Cycle: Definition, Phases, and Diagram](https://www.sciencefacts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cell-Cycle-Diagram.jpg)

S (synthesis) is where we replicate [[DNA]]

G1
- Grow
- Produce more VIP molecules and structures ([[enzyme]]s, nucleotides, etc.)
S
- Replication of [[DNA]]
G2
- Finish Growing
- Produce more VIP molecules in preparation for division

The cell cycle is a series of events in which an organisms cells grow and divide to form two genetically identical daughter cells.

Cells going through the cell cycle alternate between two major phases:
- [[Interphase]]
- [[Mitosis]] / Cytokinesis (detailed in [[Mitosis]])

## Cell Cycle Timing & Control
G0 cells can enter and leave the cell cycle based on environmental signals and ques.

Not all cells divide at the same rate.

There are cells that go into G0 and never go back into the dividing phase.

How often cells divide is usually a function of how often they are used or exposed to damaging conditions.
Some cells don't go through the cell cycle at all.

Cell cycle is 24h long.
[[Interphase]] is 23/24ths of that time

Cells know to move on to the next step
- Growth factor signals the cell to produce checkpoint specific cyclin [[protein]]s
- Cyclin proteins produced via [[protein]] synthesis
- At high enough concentration, cyclin binds to its specific CDK.
- CDK initiates a [[phosphorylation]] cascade that allows the cell past the checkpoint in order to continue the cell cycle.
- Phase-specific cyclin is used to prevent improper signaling.

Cells are required to pass through 3 checkpoints as they progress through the cell cycle.

Cells check for damage, mutations and proper internal conditions at each checkpoint.

***Healthy Cells Complete The Cell Cycle***
Damaged/ mutated cells enter cell cycle arrest.
During this the cell produces cyclin inhibitors, turning off the Cell Cycle.

### What happens after a mutation is detected?
2 things can happen:
- Repairable Damage/Mutations
	The damaged [[DNA]] is repaired and continues through the cell cycle.
- Non-Repairable
	Cell undergoes [[apoptosis]] and is eliminated, preventing diseases like cancer.
# Developing Organisms
Developing Organisms require production of new cells that posses a complete genome in order to grow.

Organismal growth occurs when cell production is greater that cell death (obvious).

Adult organisms use the cell cycle to replace dying [[Somatic Cells]].

Asexually reproducing organisms use the cell cycle to pass their [[DNA]] to the next generation.

# Cancer
Uncontrolled cell growth leading to tumors.
Cancer cells have an accumulation of mutations in genes that prevent damaged cells from continuing in the cell cycle.
These mutations prevent [[apoptosis]] and allow the cancer cell to reproduce and divide unlimitedly.
