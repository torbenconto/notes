Nucleotides are the monomers of RNA.
Composed of three chemical groups:
- 5 carbon ribose sugar
- Phosphate is attached to the 5' ribose carbon
- Nitrogenous bases
		Adenine
		Thymine
		Cytosine
		Uracil

3'OH group is required for dehydration synthesis of nucleotides during transcription.
Accidental use  of the 2'OH group for dehydration is why RNA is less stable for long term storage of hereditary traits.

The 4 RNA Nucelotides
A pairs with U
T pairs with C

## Transcription
RNA nucleotides are always added across from their complimentary base on the template [[DNA]] strand.

## 3 RNA structures
Transfer RNA (tRNA)
T shaped structure made of RNA nucleotides
Amino acids are attached on the top, and the anticodon is on the bottom loop.
Transfer RNA is responsible for carrying amino acids to the ribosome during translation.

Messenger RNA (mRNA)
Single stranded sequence of RNA nucleotides

An RNA copy of [[DNA]] used to send messages.

## FILL IN FUNCTION

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
Sequence of RNA nucleotides that bind to ribosomal [[protein]]s in order to form the whole[[Ribosome]].

A structural component of a [[Ribosome]] that assist with translation of mRNA
