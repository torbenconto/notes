Reproductive barriers that occur prior to fertilization, preventing formation of offspring.

- Habitat isolation
	Physical separation prevents members of two [[species]] from mating and producing offspring, can be [[allopatric]] or [[sympatric]]
- Temporal isolation
	Time of the mating seasons prevents members of different [[species]] from mating and producing offspring.
- Behavioral isolation
	Differences in behaviors, mating rituals, and mating calls prevent members of different [[species]] from mating and producing offspring.
- Mechanical isolation
	Differences in reproductive anatomy prevent members of different [[species]] from mating and producing offspring.
- Gametic isolation
	Differences in [[gamete]]s prevent members of different [[species]] from mating and producing offspring.
