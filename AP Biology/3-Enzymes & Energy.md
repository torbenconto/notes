An [[enzyme]] is a type of [[protein]]
				enzymes
Reactants ---> Products
	reactants are acted upon to make products

The combination of chemical reactions that synthesize and hydrolyze biomolecules for energy storage and usage. 

Free energy is the actually energy available to a cell for use in metabolic processes.

Catabolic reaction break down biological polymers into monomers to help generate [[ATP]]
- These reactions are [[exergonic]]

Anabolic reactions build monomers into polymers (energy storage)
- These reactions are [[endergonic]]

[[exergonic]] reactions release free energy that is used by [[endergonic]] reactions so they can occur. This is called reaction coupling.

All chemical reactions require a certain amount of energy to occur.
- Called Activation Energy

Enzymes lower this activation energy required for a reaction, which makes it go faster.

This only lowers the Activation Energy, does not add or take away energy from the reaction.

### Dehydration Synthesis
Process by which monomers are covalently bonded together into polymers.
Requires enzymes to occur.
Forms water as a by-product.

### Hydrolysis
Process by which polymers are broken down into monomers.
Water is used as a reactant.

### Digestive Enzymes
The mouth, stomach, and small intestine all have enzymes that help break down food polymers into monomers.
- Amylase is a mouth enzyme that breaks down starch
- Pepsin is a stomach enzyme that breaks down proteins

Enzymes in the intestines use hydrolysis to break down food polymers.

### Enzymes and the Environment
Enzymes have to be in their optimal conditions to work at their best.
Enzymes outside these conditions will be less efficient.
Enzymes in extreme conditions will denature, eliminate it's ability to catalyze reactions.
Most enzymes in the human body work best at 96.7 deg f and a PH of 7.

Enzymes have a maximum rate. 
Enzyme efficiency is a measure of how close they are to that maximum rate.
There are several factors which effect efficiency
- Optimal conditions
- Substrate concentration
- Enzyme concentration
- Inhibitors


### Temperature
Temperature has a variable of effect on enzyme reaction rates.

Below Temp
-----------
Lack of energy decreases the amount of collisions between the enzyme and substrate.
Reaction rate slows or stops.
Heating back up will increase the efficiency.

Above Temp
---------
Too much energy avalible
Causes amino acid side chains to move faster which disrupts weak interactions between amino acid side chains.
This disrupts the tertiary structure of the enzyme, causing denaturation.
Cooling them down will do nothing because they are denatured and cannot work anymore.





Denatured enzymes do not have the correct active site shape, preventing the substrate from binding. This slows or stops the reaction rate.

### pH
Raising the pH
---------
Substances with a basic ph have a high concentration of OH- ions.
OH- ions break hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions, disrupting secondary and tertiary structure and causing the enzyme to denature.

Lowering the PH
----------
Substances with an acidic ph have a high concentration of H+ ions.
H+ ions break hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions, disrupting secondary and tertiary structure and causing the enzyme to denature.


### Substrate Concentration
Changing substrate concentration will effect the enzyme rate by altering the likelihood and speed with which the enzyme and substrate will collide.
The same occurs when increasing enzyme concentration.

Rate can only increase to the maximum rate for that enzyme because at the max rate, 100% of the enzymes are being occupied by substrate.


### Enzyme helpers
Cofactors
- non-protein
- small inorganic compounds bound within enzyme molecule
Coenzymes

### Inhibitors
Sometimes a cell needs to turn off an enzyme to maintain homeostasis. (to not waste energy)

Competitive inhibition
- Inhibitors and substrate have similar shapes and compete for the active site of the enzyme
- Inhibitor binds to the active site, preventing the substrate from doing so
Non-competitive inhibition
- Binds to a different site and changes the shape of the active site

Inhibitors can bind reversibly or irreversibly. Irreversible inhibitors permanently deactivate an enzyme. 


### Enzyme Graphs
Determine the optimal temp or pH by finding the peak on the graph.

### Negative Feedback Inhibition
Metabolic pathways are a series of chemical reactions with multiple steps.
Sometimes an intermediate or a final product of the pathway will act as an inhibitor of enzymes in the pathway. This is called negative feedback


# Photosynthesis
Plants look green because they reflect the color green.
Solar energy is converted into chemical potential energy stored in the bonds of glucose through carbon fixation. All energy on earth comes from the sun.

MUST REMEMBER

#### Two Phases
Light dependent and Light independent reactions have a reciprocal relationship.
Products of Light dependent reactions are the reactants of Light independent reactions.

### Oxidation Reductions
A type of reactions that requires simultaneous reduction and oxidation of two reactants.
This is another type of reaction coupling.
Photosynthesis and cellular respiration both rely on redox reactions to shuttle electrons between the [[endergonic]] and [[exergonic]] parts of the process.

![TASK 2: OXIDATION AND REDUCTION - PRINCIPLES IN BIOCHEMISTRY](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmerinyjoreenmatias.weebly.com%2Fuploads%2F6%2F1%2F1%2F3%2F61137203%2F4231564_orig.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=8ba2733503e7556e20e5f520a8f172c1e0505b9cd739c59a4001336963a7dec0&ipo=images)

### Oxidation
Oxidized molecules will lose/give up electrons.
You can identify oxidized compounds by looking for
- Loss of atoms like hydrogen or carbon
- Gain of a positive charge

### Reduction
Reduced molecules will gain/receive electrons.
You can identify reduced compounds by looking for
- Gain of atoms like hydrogen or carbon
- Loss of a positive charge

### Electron Carriers
Molecules that can be both oxidized and reduced.
Electron carriers shuttle high-energy electrons from the light dependent reactions to the light independent reactions.
Examples
- NADP+/NADPH
- NAD+/NADH
- FADH/FADH_2

Surrounded by cytoplasm.
# Light independent reactions occur in the Stroma.
# Light dependent is in the thylakoid membrane.

#### Thylakoid membrane
Membrane surrounding the Thylakoid.
Contains the photosystem proteins and ATP synthase.
Photosystem proteins chlorophyll molecules.
The inside of this is called the lumen.
The outside of this is called the stroma.

### Chlorophyll
Light absorbing pigment contained in photosystem proteins.
Absorb all wavelengths of light except for green.
## Hydrogen atom structure
A proton with one single electron.
Photons of light can strike and transfer energy into valence shell electrons.
This excites the electron and causes it to jump up higher energy level orbitals.
It is possible for electron carriers to capture these electrons, leaving behind an ionized molecule.
This works for all molecules, not just Hydrogen.
Acidic pH's have a high concentration of H+ ions.

## Light and Energy
Each color of light has its own wavelength and energy levels.
As wavelength increases, the amount of energy in the light decreases.
Violet has the highest energy
Red has the lowest energy

### Absorbance Spectra

## Origin of Photosynthesis 
Ancestral prokaryotes were the first to evolve the use of photosynthesis on specialized internal membranes. The evolution of photosynthesis introduced oxygen into early earths atmosphere.

Symbiotic relationship between a prokaryote that could photosynthesize and one that couldn't. Just like the endo-symbiotic theory.

## Light-dependent reactions
occur in the thylakoid membrane
Inputs: NADP+, ADP, H2O
Outputs: NADHP, ATP, O2

## Electron Transport Chain
Light strikes an electron in chlorophyll photosystem 2.
Electron is excited to a high-energy state.
High energy electrons move through a series of.
Photosystems until it reaches photosystem 1.
Energy from the moving electron is used to actively transport H+ ions from the stroma into the lumen, creating and maintaining an H+ ion gradient across the thylakoid membrane.

Electron is out of energy by the time it reaches photosystem one.
Another photon of light hits the electron and excites it again.
This electron is captured by NADP+ and a hydrogen ion to reduce NADP+ into NADPH
NADPH is transported and used in the light independents reactions.

2 is used first, 1 second
(photosystems)

## Photolysis
Water is struck by a photon of light and broken into O2, H+ ions and electrons.
- Electrons are used to replenish photosystem 2
- O2 is released as a waste product.
- H+ ions help to maintain the concentration gradient.

## Chemiosmosis
The electron transport chain generated an H+ ion gradient across the membrane.
H+ ions diffuse through a channel in ATP synthase.
ATP synthase is like a water wheel generating ATP as it lets H+ ions diffuse.
Energy of diffusion allows ATP synthase to make ATP from ADP by adding a phosphate.
ATP is transported and used to power the light independent reactions.

## The Calvin cycle (light independent)
occurs in the stroma of a chloroplast
Inputs: CO2, NADPH, ATP
Outputs: Glucose, NADP+, ADP

NADPH and ATP are oxidized, the energy released from this oxidation is used by the enzyme RuBisCo to reduce and fix inorganic carbon from CO2 into an organic form in glucose.
This regenerates NADP+ and ADP, which are recycled back to the light dependent reactions.
The Calvin cycle must run twice to create one glucose molecule.

## Measuring the rate of photosynthesis
The best way to measure the rate of a chemical reaction is to measure the change in concentration of the substrate or product over time.

to measure oxygen production you can submerge it
to measure co2 you need a special chamber


## Cellular Respiration
Occurs in the [[Mitochondria]]

Process that organisms use to convert chemical energy stored in the bonds of glucose into usable chemical energy in the form of [[ATP]].

ALL LIVING ORGANISMS utilize cellular respiration.

Two types
- Aerobic - with oxygen
- Anerobic - without oxygen

#### Anerobic
Does not require oxygen, also called fermentation.
The main purpose of it is to regenerate the electron carrier NAD+ for use in glycolysis.

Lactic acid can be converted back to pyruvate because it is a 3 carbon sugar.

Reactions that breakdown [[ATP]] to oxidize NADH into NAD+ in the absence of oxygen.

Allows glycolysis to occur even if aerobic respiration is not occurring and replenishing the NAD+ supply.

two forms 
- Lactic acid fermentation
- Alcohol fermentation 


#### Aerobic 
Also know as just respiration, requires oxygen.
The main purpose of it is to generate [[ATP]] for use in cellular processes that maintain homeostasis.

The best way to measure the rate of a chemical reaction is to measure the change in concentration of the substrate or product over time.

Variable to Measure
Oxygen consuption over time for oxidative phosphorylation
CO2 production over time for FILL IN

Glucose + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water
c6h12o2 + 6o2      ->   6co2 + 6H2O

Reverse of photosynthesis reaction

Steps
- Glycolysis
- Pyruvate oxidation (linking step) how pyruvate gets into the [[Mitochondria]]
- Citric acid cycle
- ETC and oxidative phosphorylation

NAD+ is converted into NADH which goes to the ETC

Linking step
Pyruvate is converted into acetyl-coA as it is transported across the mitochondrial membranes and into the matrix. used in the citric acid cycle

### Citric acid cycle
Krebs cycle
Aceytl-coA goes through a series of exergonic chemical reactions to reduce NAD+ into NADH and FADH to FADH2 both of which go to the ETC

ADP converted into ATP

Multiply the totals by 2 to get the amount produced per glucose

### Electron transport chain
ETC occurs on the inner [[Mitochondria]] membrane
NADH and FADH2 are oxidized, releasing electrons and energy.
Electrons move through the ETC, losing energy until they combine with o2 and h+ ions to form water as a waste product.
Energy released is used to maintain an H+ ion gradient across the inner [[Mitochondria]] membrane

### Oxidative Phosphorylation
Coupled with ETC
H+ ions diffuse through ATP synthase, from the matrix to the intermembrane space.
Energy from this diffusion is captured and used by ATP synthase to phosphorylate ADP into [[ATP]]
Generates 32-34 [[ATP]]

#### Oxidative efficiency
Energy that is not captured from oxidation of NADH during the ETC is given off as heat. Homeothermic organisms will decouple the ETC and Oxidative Phosphorylation to generate more heat and regulate body temperature

## Glycolysis
"breaking down of sugar"
Set of anaerobic chemical reactions that occur in the cytoplasm to oxidize glucose into 2 molecules of pyruvate/pyruvic acid (3 carbon sugar).
Requires reduction of 2 NAD+ to NADH
Requires 2 [[ATP]] but returns 4 [[ATP]]

Occurs in the cytoplasm

Must occur before anything else can happen respiration wise.
Pyruvate is the precursor for both anaerobic and aerobic respiration.
All living organisms use glycolysis which is a major evidence piece for common ancestry.

## Electron Carriers
Molecules that can be both oxidized and reduced

Move high energy electrons from various steps of aerobic respiration to the electron transport chain
For cellular respiration
- NAD+/NADH

## Origins of Cellular Respiration
Ancestral prokaryotes were the first to evolve the use of aerobic cellular respiration on specialized internal membranes.
This allowed ancestral prokaryotes to process oxygen without dying.
Eukaryotic cells capable of performing aerobic respiration evolved as a result of endosymbiosis between a prokaryote capable of aerobic respiration and a prokaryote not capable of aerobic respiration.
