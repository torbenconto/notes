[[RNA]]

# Flow of information in a cell

[[DNA]] ---> [[RNA]] ---> [[protein]]
Mutations can cause changes in the m[[RNA]] sequence, which may change the amino acid sequence and stop the [[protein]] from working effectively. Proteins that don't work will cause a change in the phenotype or physical expression of the trait. Sometimes this leads to diseases.

Gene expression requires both [[transcription]] and [[translation]].

## Alternative splicing
Introns are removed from pre-[[RNA]] molecules by [[protein]] complexes called spliceosomes.
If an exon is flanked by introns, the spliceosome may choose to remove it along with the introns.
This will alter the m[[RNA]] sequence, thus changing the [[protein]]s shape and altering it's function.
This is not a mutation; its a function that Eukaryotes use to produce more than one [[protein]] from one [[gene]]

# Mutations
A change in [[DNA]] sequence
Most mutations have no effect on an organism

Mutations can sometimes increase genetic variation in a population.
This only occurs if the mutation causes a change in the [[protein]] that alters the phenotype of the mutant organism.

[[allele]] frequency changes, evolution occurs

## Reading Frame
Reading frame refers to the sequence of nucleotides that actually codes for a [[protein]] and is read by the [[Ribosome]]. Any mutations in the reading frame can cause a change in protein structure

## Point Mutations
Usually a change in 1 to 3 nucleotides and only effect one [[gene]].

Occur during [[DNA]] synthesis in the cell cycle.
### Substitution Mutations
A type of point mutation where the original nucleotide is replace by a different nucleotide.

Can be silent meaning that the mutation doesn't change anything in the phenotype.

### Missense Mutation
A change in a single nucleotide results in a change in a single amino acid in the sequence

Possibilities:
- [[protein]] doesn't work
- Decreased functionality of the [[protein]]
- Increased functionality of the [[protein]]

### Nonsense Mutation
A change in a single nucleotide that results in a premature stop codon in the m[[RNA]] sequence.

### Frameshift Mutation
A type of mutation where addition or removal of a single nucleotide changes the reading frame for the [[protein]]. Always has a negative effect.

### Insertion Mutation
Insertion of a single nucleotide into the [[DNA]] sequence
Insertions change the reading frame which also change the entire amino acid sequence after the insertion.
[[protein]] will not fold correctly.

### Deletion Mutation 
The day I need notes for this mutation is the day of my death.

## Chromosomal Mutations
Mutations that effect big sections of [[chromosome]]s and effect many [[gene]].

Occur during [[meiosis]].


# Gene Regulation
Process in which organisims control which genes are being expressed; allows for differential gene expression in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.

Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes use regulatory sequences in their [[DNA]].

cells can control which genes are available for transcription by adding small histone [[protein]] tails with small chemical groups.

- Addition of a methyl group permanently silences the expression of a gene.
- Addition of an acetyl group turns expression on in that area.
These histone modifications are heritable from parents to offspring.

## RNA interference
Small, non-coding sequences of [[RNA]] called microRNA are produced by the dicer protein. These sequences bind to complementary m[[RNA]] sequences.

When mi[[RNA]] binds:
- m[[RNA]] is degraded OR
- [[transcription]] is blocked
Either way, [[gene]] expression is silenced.

## Eukaryotic
Eukaryotic genes are frequently grouped together and activated by the same transcription factors.

Allows for complementary genes involved in complex cell responses to be activated at the same time.

Eukaryotes can regulate gene expression at all levels of the [[gene]] expression pathway.
- Epigenetics ([[DNA]] access control)
	controls which genes are physically avalible
- Pre-transcriptional control
	Control production of [[transcription]] factors to prevent or activate [[transcription]] of target [[gene]]s
- Post-transcriptional
	// FILL IN
- Pre-[[translation]]al control
	m[[RNA]] destruction directed by non-coding micro[[RNA]] molecules
- Post-[[translation]]al control
	 // FILL IN

## Prokaryotes
Prokaryotes organize their [[gene]]s into transcriptional units called operons.

Operons allow prokaryotes to quickly turn [[gene]]s on and off in // FILL IN

Prokaryotes couple [[transcription]] and [[translation]], so their main [[gene]] regulation strategy is to control [[transcription]].
They do this by grouping their genes in [[transcription]]al units called operons.
The [[gene]]s in an operon are transcribed as a single m[[RNA]] sequence, but the presence of multiple stop and start codons allows for the production of several different [[protein]]s from one m[[RNA]]

Operons have two types:
- Inducible operons
	sets of [[gene]]s that are normally repressed and need to be turned on in order for the bacteria to maintain homeostasis.
- Repressible operons
	sets of [[gene]]s that are normally expressed and need to be repressed in order for the bacteria to maintain homeostasis.

# Regulatory Sequences
Stretches of [[DNA]] that interact with regulatory [[protein]]s to control [[transcription]].

Regulatory sequences dont code for a protein.

Regulatory sequences allow for positive or negative control of [[transcription]]

Regulatory sequences do not need to be close to the [[gene]]

## Positive Sequences
Promotes sequences occur upstream (5') of the gene; [[transcription]] factor binds here, which help [[RNA]] polymerase enzymes to bind and initiate [[transcription]]

Enhancer sequences can occur upstream (5') or downstream(3') of a [[gene]]; activator [[protein]]s bind to them and interact with [[transcription]] factors to promote [[RNA]] polymerase binding; sometimes increases amount of m[[RNA]] produced.

## Negative Sequences
Repressor [[protein]]s that bind to the promoter sequence prevent [[RNA]] polymerase from binding and initiating [[transcription]].

Silencer sequences can occur upstream (5') or downstream(3') of a [[gene]]; repressor [[protein]]s bind to them, which stops [[transcription]] of [[gene]]s, usually by blocking [[RNA]] polymerase from binding or transcribing.

# Importance of [[gene]] regulation
Allows prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells to fine tune how much of a [[protein]] is being made at any given time in response to changes in the cell environment.
Maintains homeostasis.

Allows pluripotent stem cells to develop into the three germ layers present during vertebrate fetal development.

Allows for differentiation of specialized cell types in multicellular organisms.
 - All cells have identical [[DNA]]
 - The cell phenotype changes due to which [[gene]]s are expressed and which aren't as well as by how much it is expressed.


# Biotechnology
Manipulation of [[DNA]] sequences in an organism.
Known as genetic engineering.
Techniques used to engineer [[gene]]s are called recombinant [[DNA]] technology.

[[PCR]]
[[Gel Electrophoresis]]

## Uses of [[DNA]] technology
- [[gene]] therapy
	Introduces a new gene to the genome
- Medicine
	Helps create new medicines
- Forensics
	Helps identify criminals
- Environmental Cleanup
	Used to break down plastics, heavy metals, oil spills, human waste, etc.
- Foods
	Modified foods to provide more nutritional value among other things.

## Plasmids
Small, circular [[DNA]] molecules.
Often found in bacteria.
Replicate independently of the [[chromosome]].
Plasmids can serve as a vector.
A vehicle for transferring recombinant [[gene]]s to a new host.
Contain [[DNA]] replication initiation site.
Contain a promoter sequence for initiating [[transcription]] of the inserted [[gene]].
Contain antibiotic resistance [[gene]].

## Cloning 
Isolate 2 different [[DNA]] = bacterial plasmid that serves as vector, and human [[DNA]] of interest.

Treat them both with the same restriction [[enzyme]] (cuts them the same).

Sticky ends of the [[DNA]] joined by [[DNA]] ligase.

Plasmid is inserted into bacterial cells through transformation.

[[gene]] cloning, bacteria reproduces and mass produces the recombinant [[DNA]].

### Applications
Recombinant plasmids are extremely useful because it allows manufacturing mass quantity of biological molecules.
- insulin
- [[protein]] used to dissolve blood clats in heart attack therapy
- Hepatitis B surface antigen used to vaccinate against the Hep B virus
- [[gene]] for pest resistance
- [[gene]] used to clean up waste

## The human genome project
The project mapped out the entire [[DNA]] genome sequence for all humans as a species.

It found that we have around 40000 different genes in our genome.
These make up only about 3% of the total genome.
Alternative [[RNA]] splicing is the key to making the hundreds of thousands of different [[protein]]s and [[enzyme]]s our bodies need to use.
A project is now being done for thousands of different species to compare their genomes to ours.
