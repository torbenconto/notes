[[RNA]]

# Flow of information in a cell

[[DNA]] ---> [[RNA]] ---> [[protein]]
Mutations can cause changes in the m[[RNA]] sequence, which may change the amino acid sequence and stop the [[protein]] from working effectively. Proteins that don't work will cause a change in the phenotype or physical expression of the trait. Sometimes this leads to diseases.

Gene expression requires both [[transcription]] and [[translation]].

## Alternative splicing
Introns are removed from pre-[[RNA]] molecules by [[protein]] complexes called spliceosomes.
If an exon is flanked by introns, the spliceosome may choose to remove it along with the introns.
This will alter the m[[RNA]] sequence, thus changing the [[protein]]s shape and altering it's function.
This is not a mutation; its a function that Eukaryotes use to produce more than one [[protein]] from one [[gene]]

# Mutations
A change in [[DNA]] sequence
Most mutations have no effect on an organism

Mutations can sometimes increase genetic variation in a population.
This only occurs if the mutation causes a change in the [[protein]] that alters the phenotype of the mutant organism.

[[allele]] frequency changes, evolution occurs

## Reading Frame
Reading frame refers to the sequence of nucleotides that actually codes for a [[protein]] and is read by the [[Ribosome]]. Any mutations in the reading frame can cause a change in protein structure

## Point Mutations
Usually a change in 1 to 3 nucleotides and only effect one [[gene]].

Occur during [[DNA]] synthesis in the cell cycle.
### Substitution Mutations
A type of point mutation where the original nucleotide is replace by a different nucleotide.

Can be silent meaning that the mutation doesn't change anything in the phenotype.

### Missense Mutation
A change in a single nucleotide results in a change in a single amino acid in the sequence

Possibilities:
- [[protein]] doesn't work
- Decreased functionality of the [[protein]]
- Increased functionality of the [[protein]]

### Nonsense Mutation
A change in a single nucleotide that results in a premature stop codon in the m[[RNA]] sequence.

### Frameshift Mutation
A type of mutation where addition or removal of a single nucleotide changes the reading frame for the [[protein]]. Always has a negative effect.

### Insertion Mutation
Insertion of a single nucleotide into the [[DNA]] sequence
Insertions change the reading frame which also change the entire amino acid sequence after the insertion.
[[protein]] will not fold correctly.

### Deletion Mutation 
The day I need notes for this mutation is the day of my death.

## Chromosomal Mutations
Mutations that effect big sections of [[chromosome]]s and effect many [[gene]].

Occur during [[meiosis]].


# Gene Regulation
Process in which organisims control which genes are being expressed; allows for differential gene expression in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.

Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes use regulatory sequences in their [[DNA]].


## Eukaryotic
Eukaryotic genes are frequently grouped together and activated by the same transcription factors.

Allows for complementary genes involved in complex cell responses to be activated at the same time.

## Prokaryotes
Prokaryotes organize their [[gene]]s into transcriptional units called operons.

Operons allow prokaryotes to quickly turn [[gene]]s on and off in 


# Regulatory Sequences
Stretches of [[DNA]] that interact with regulatory [[protein]]s to control [[transcription]].

Regulatory sequences dont code for a protein.

Regulatory sequences allow for positive or negative control of [[transcription]]

Regulatory sequences do not need to be close to the [[gene]]

## Positive Sequences
Promotes sequences occur upstream (5') of the gene; [[transcription]] factor binds here, which help [[RNA]] polymerase enzymes to bind and initiate [[transcription]]

Enhancer sequences can occur upstream (5') or downstream(3') of a [[gene]]; activator [[protein]]s bind to them and interact with [[transcription]] factors to promote [[RNA]] polymerase binding; sometimes increases amount of m[[RNA]] produced.

## Negative Sequences
Repressor [[protein]]s that bind to the promoter sequence prevent [[RNA]] polymerase from binding and initiating [[transcription]].

Silencer sequences can occur upstream (5') or downstream(3') of a [[gene]]; repressor [[protein]]s bind to them, which stops [[transcription]] of [[gene]]s, usually by blocking [[RNA]] polymerase from binding or transcribing.

# Importance of [[gene]] regulation
Allows prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells to fine tune how much of a [[protein]] is being made at any given time in response to changes in the cell environment.
Maintains homeostasis.

Allows pluripotent stem cells to develop into the three germ layers present during vertebrate fetal development.

Allows for differentiation of specialized cell types in multicellular organisms.
 - All cells have identical [[DNA]]
 - The cell phenotype changes due to which [[gene]]s are expressed and which aren't as well as by how much it is expressed.
