A change in the [[allele]] frequency in a population over time.

A change in a population, NOT an individual

Two areas of study
- [[microevolution]]
- [[macroevolution]]

# Recipe for evolution
Requires:
- Variation in characteristics between individuals in a population.
- Overproduction of offspring  
- Competition for limited resources

Organisms that possess genetic variations that allow them to outcompete others for resources will survive and pass their [[gene]]s on to the next generation, thus shifting the [[allele]] frequency to their traits.

Evolutionary [[fitness]]
# Mechanisms for evolution
- [[Genetic Drift]]
- [[Sexual Selection]]
- [[Mutations]]
- [[Gene Flow]]
- [[Natural Selection]]

## Artificial Selection
Selective and adaptive change in [[allele]] frequency caused by humans selecting and breeding members of species for specific traits.


## Directional Selection
When the selective pressure favors the [[allele]]s from one phenotype over the other.

## Stabilizing Selection
When the selective pressures favor the [[allele]] that represents the mean or middle

## Disruptive Selection
When the selective pressures favor the extreme phenotypes

# Hardy-Weinberg 
States that in the absence of any evolutionary driving forces, the allele frequency in the population will remain constant over time.

pop. must meet the following criteria:
no [[Natural Selection]]
no [[Gene Flow]]
no [[Mutations]]
no [[Sexual Selection]]
no [[Genetic Drift]]

if any of the conditions are not met, the population is not in H-W equilibrium and is evolving.

Only theoretical, cannot happen in nature.

## Equations
`p + q = 1`
p is the frequency of the dominant [[allele]]
q is the frequency of the recessive [[allele]]

`p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1`
p^2 is the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype
2pq is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype
q^2 is the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype.

# Speciation
[[species]]
The formation of a new, distinct [[species]] (from a common ancestor) as a direct result of reproductive isolation.

Reproductive isolation means that two offspring can no longer interbreed and produce fertile offspring.

Two broad types
- [[allopatric]]
- [[sympatric]]

Reproductive barriers are a product of evolutionary mechanisms in both [[allopatric]] and [[sympatric]] speciation.

- Increased species diversity allows for more genetic variation and therefore better survival against changes in the environment.
- This prevents the extinction of life on earth.

### Reproductive Barriers
Refers to the various ways that organisms can become reproductively isolated.

Two types:
- [[prezygotic barriers]]
- [[postzygotic barriers]]

# Common Ancestry
Overtime, evolution can lead to speciation of populations.

A common ancestor is a [[species]] of organism from which one or more new [[species]] evolve from.
All living organisms have a distant common ancestor as evidenced by the fact that all organisms share the same fundamental molecular and cellular features.

All living eukaryotic [[2-Cells]] share a distant common ancestor as evidenced by the fact that they all
- Have membrane bound organelles

More recent common ancestor = more related to each other and vice versa.

Common ancestry is illustrated in diagrams known as [[phylogenetic tree]]s and [[cladogram]].

Evidence:
- [[Biogeography]]
- [[Anatomical Homologies]]
- [[Homologous Structures]]
- [[Developmental Homologies]]
- [[Molecular Homologies]]
- [[Fossil Records]]

[[Adaptive Radiation]]
[[Gradualism]]
[[Punctuated Equilibrium]]

# Evolution is a continuing process
Populations are continuing to evolve because [[allele]] frequencies change from generation to generation.
We see evidence for this in:
Changes in [[DNA]] sequences over time.
Changes in the [[Fossil Records]]
Antibiotic resistant.

# Extinction
Extinction events have occured many times in earth's history.
Extinction rates are a function of ecological stress.
Human activity is a major contributor to ecological stress.
The higher genetic diversity a [[species]] has, the less likely it is to go extinct.
