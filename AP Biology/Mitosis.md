#definition 
Division of the [[Nucleus]]

Prophase
- [[Nucleus]] dissolves
- [[DNA]] condenses, [[chromosome]]s are visible
- [[Spindle fiber]]s form
Metaphase (middle phase)
- [[Spindle fiber]]s attach to [[chromosome]]s
- [[chromosome]]s line up on the [[Equitorial Plate]]
Anaphase
- Contact [[Spindle fiber]]s to move one set of [[chromosome]]s to the opposite poles of the cell
Telophase
- [[Nucleus]] reforms
- [[DNA]] decondenses
- [[Cell membrane]] starts pinching in (animal cells)
Cytokinesis
- [[Cytoplasm]] divides
- [[Cell membrane]] pinches to form two genetically identical daughter cells.
