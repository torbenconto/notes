Why do different types of cells have very different structures in organism?
Because structure effects function so in order for them to function different they need to be structured different.

A cell is a group of organelles and molecules working together to perform a specific task and help the organism maintain homeostasis. Living organisms must have at least one cell. 
Two types of organisms
- single celled
- multicellular

Two types of cells
- prokaryotes don't have a nucleus
- eukaryotes have a nucleus

## Prokaryotes
- Bacteria and archaebacteria. 
- Single celled only. 
- No nucleus. 
- No membrane-bound organelles. 
- Smaller and simpler cells. 
- Oldest cells

## Eukaryotes
- Plants, animals, protists. fungi
- Single or multi-cellular
- Have membrane-bound organelles
- Larger and more complex
- Evolve from prokaryotic cells

## Both
- Both have genetic material ([[DNA]] or [[RNA]])
- Cell membrane
- Ribosomes
- Some Pro and Eukaryotes have cell walls others have flagella
- Both use cellular respiration to make [[ATP]]

Cells can be anywhere from 10 micrometer to 1 millimeter in length. They need to be big enough to fit all the [[DNA]] and genetic material but small enough to efficiently exchange nutrients with the extracellular environment to maintain homeostasis.

The rate of diffusion of a substance is the same regardless of the cell size. However, cell size effects how far it will travel into the shell. Cells need to have a large SA:V ration to be efficient at transport. High surface area = more places for materials to enter, Small volume = shorter distance for materials to travel.
#### Projections
Folding of the membrane which increases surface area and therefore the SA:V ratio. Cells with projections will be more efficient at transporting materials compared to other cell shapes.

### Surface area & volume
Need to be able to calculate surface area and volume of a cube.



## Cell shape and function
A cells shape and the amount and type of organelles it has determines the function of the cell.
For example sperm cells have a lot of energy and a long flagella because they need to swim

## Non-membrane bound 
- Organelles that don't have their own membrane inside of the cell
- [[Ribosome]]
- [[Cell wall]]
- [[Cytoplasm]]

## Membrane bound
- Organelles that have their own membrane inside of the cell.
- [[Nucleus]]
- [[Vacuole]]
- [[Mitochondria]]
- [[Chloroplast]]
- [[Golgi]]
- [[Rough Endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Smooth Endoplasmic reticulum]]

Membrane bound organelles compartmentalize different areas of the cell allowing those areas to have different conditions. This allows for specialization of different areas of the cell to do different jobs and concentrate enzymes and substrate in the same physical area.

Organelle membranes are usually folded to increase surface area.
Increased surface area is important because it gives ,more real estate for reactions/[[enzyme]]s to exist without making the organelles too big. 
More specialization = more complex life

## Endomembrane System
What is an organelle that you know about, and what does it do to help an organism maintain homeostasis?
[[Mitochondria]]

[[Cell membrane]]

[[Cell wall]]

[[Ribosome]]

[[Cytoplasm]]

[[Cytoskeleton]]

[[Centriole]]

[[Flagella]] and [[Cilia]]
Both help move cells around
Flagella are longer and move like a propeller

[[Nucleus]]
[[Nucleolus]]

[[Golgi]] Apparatus

[[Peroxisome]]

[[Lysosomes]]

[[Vacuole]]

[[Mitochondria]]


[[Chloroplast]]

## Membrane Structure and Function

The membrane is often referred to as a fluid mosaic model. What do you think this means in terms of structure and function?
It lets things past it and is made up of pieces.

[[glycolipid]]
[[glycoprotein]]
[[phospholipid]]s

#### Peripheral Proteins
- Found attached to the inside or outside surface of the cell
- Usually used for cell signaling

#### Integral Proteins
- Fully or partially embedded in the membrane.
- Also used for cell signaling

#### Transmembrane proteins
- Go all the way through the membrane
- Usually found as channel proteins that move polar/large molecules in and out of the cell
- Special type of integral proteins

#### Channel Protein
- Transmembrane proteins with a channel through the middle
- Used for the transport of large, polar, or charged molecules across the membrane

#### Receptor Proteins
- Can either be transmembrane or peripheral
- Sticking out to receive messages
- Used for cell signaling. Ligands bind to the receptor and cause the cell to respond accordingly.

#### Fluid mosaic Model
This membrane is frequently referred to as a fluid mosaic. This means it is made of many components that can move laterally in the membrane.

## Concentration Gradient
The difference in concentration of molecules across a space.
Biological concentration gradients occur when there is a difference in the concentration of biomolecules, water, or ions across the [[Cell membrane]].
As an FRQ:
	Molecules moving with the concentration gradient are moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration of the molecule that is moving.

## Molecular energy and Net Movement
Atoms/molecules have inherent energy that causes them to vibrate and move around.
The direction in which the molecules move is random.

Net Movement refers to the direction that most molecules move. Mostly follows the concentration gradient.

## Cell Transport
Process by which cells exchange nutrients, waste, and other materials with the extracellular environment.
### Passive transport
Net movement of molecules with the concentration gradient until the system reaches dynamic equilibrium. Relies on the inherent energy of the concentration gradient. Does not require the input of [[ATP]] to occur.
- [[Simple diffusion]]
- [[Facilitated diffusion]]
- [[Osmosis]]
### Active transport
Net movement of molecules against the concentration gradient. The system will not reach dynamic equilibrium. Requires the input of [[ATP]] to occur.

## Facilitated Transport
Large, polar, and charged molecules require the facilitation of channel proteins to cross the dense, hydrophobic core of the [[Cell membrane]]. [[Facilitated diffusion]] and Active Transport are both examples of facilitated transport.

## Aquaporins ( [[Facilitated diffusion]] )
Large channels that water can travel through
// FILL IN

## Sodium-potassium pump (facilitated transport)
// FILL IN

## Membrane Potential
Separation of charge across the membrane creates membrane potential. Membrane acts like a battery. When ions change concentrations on both sides of the membrane through transport, the membrane can become polarized and fire an electrical signal.

## Tonicity
The way we describe how much solute is dissolved in the solvent. Have to know tonicity of the solutions on either side of the membrane to predict where the water will go.
- Hypoosmotic - lower solute concentration with more free water


## Endocytosis (Active Transport)
Process by which cells take in molecules into the intracellular space.

Requires formation of a vesicle for bulk importation of substance.
Requires [[ATP]]

## Exocytosis (Active Transport)
Process by which cells release molecules into the extracellular space.

Requires formation of a vesicle for bulk exportation of substance.
Requires [[ATP]]
### Dynamic Equilibrium
Occurs when molecules moving with the concentration gradient reach the same net concentration on both sides of the membrane. Molecules are still moving but net movement is zero.
- Cells will remain in dynamic equilibrium until work using [[ATP]] energy is done to reset the concentration.
## Protein secretion from the cell
R [[Ribosome]]s on the [[Rough Endoplasmic reticulum]] synthesize [[protein]]s and import them into the
E [[Smooth Endoplasmic reticulum]] where they are folded and tagged for shipment to the 
G [[Golgi]] apparatus which packages them into 
V [[Vesicle]]s which are transported to the
C [[Cell Membrane]] where they are fused to it and the [[protein]]s can be secreted into the extracellular space


## Endosymbiotic theory 
(inside working together) States that a prokaryotic cell engulfed another prokaryotic cell and developed the [[Mitochondria]] and other simple organelles. Eukaryotic cells evolved after a large ancestral prokaryote ingested [[Mitochondria]] and [[Chloroplast]] like prokaryotes. 

Justification
- Double membrane
- Susceptible to antibiotics
- Reproduction occurs through fusion
- Have own [[DNA]]
- Have [[Ribosome]]s identical to the ones in prokaryotes
