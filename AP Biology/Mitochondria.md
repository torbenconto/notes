#definition 
Produces energy which allows the rest of the cell to function and move around.
Has two membranes
Outer - smooth not folded
Inner - Folding of inner membrane increases surface area for more/faster [[ATP]] production

Responsible for some of the processes which synthesize [[ATP]]
Citric acid cycle 
Oxidation phosphorylation

Inner membrane is the site of electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation
Matrix is where the citric acid cycle happens
Outer membrane is where the linking step happens.

Has [[DNA]] and [[Ribosome]]s
