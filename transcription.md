Process by which [[RNA]] polymerase synthesizes an m[[RNA]] copy of the target [[gene]]

Step 1: Initiation
Transcription factor binds to the promoter sequence
Transcription factors form a quaternary complex, recruiting [[RNA]] polymerase to the promoter.

Step 2: Elongation
[[RNA]] polymerase synthesizes m[[RNA]] by adding complementary nucleotides across from the template [[DNA]] strand.

Step 3: Termination
Transcription of a terminator sequence prevents further transcription.
Transcribed terminator sequences base pair with themselves, forming a hairpin loop of the m[[RNA]] sequence that stops further transcription.



## Eukaryotic post transcriptional processing
Introns are non-coding regions of the pre-m[[RNA]] transcript and must be removed before translation.

m[[RNA]] must have specific modifications to be allowed through the nuclear pore and into the [[Cytoplasm]].

m[[RNA]] transcript need protection against nucleases found in the [[Cytoplasm]].

## Prokaryotes
Prokaryotic transcription occurs in the [[Cytoplasm]].
Prokaryotes do not have introns (non-protein coding) sequences in their [[DNA]], so prokaryotic mRNA is immediately available for [[translation]] by the [[Ribosome]]

## Eukaryotes
Occurs in the [[Nucleus]]
Eukaryotes do have intron sequences in their [[DNA]], so eukaryotic m[[RNA]] has to be processed before it can leave the [[Nucleus]] to be translated.
