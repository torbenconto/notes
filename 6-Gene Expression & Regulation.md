[[RNA]]

# Flow of information in a cell

[[DNA]] ---> [[RNA]] ---> [[protein]]
Mutations can cause changes in the m[[RNA]] sequence, which may change the amino acid sequence and stop the [[protein]] from working effectively. Proteins that don't work will cause a change in the phenotype or physical expression of the trait. Sometimes this leads to diseases.

Gene expression requires both [[transcription]] and [[translation]].

## Alternative splicing
Introns are removed from pre-[[RNA]] molecules by [[protein]] complexes called spliceosomes.
If an exon is flanked by introns, the spliceosome may choose to remove it along with the introns.
This will alter the m[[RNA]] sequence, thus changing the [[protein]]s shape and altering it's function.
This is not a mutation; its a function that Eukaryotes use to produce more than one [[protein]] from one [[gene]]

# Mutations
A change in [[DNA]] sequence
Most mutations have no effect on an organism

Mutations can sometimes increase genetic variation in a population.
This only occurs if the mutation causes a change in the [[protein]] that alters the phenotype of the mutant organism.

[[allele]] frequency changes, evolution occurs

## Reading Frame
Reading frame refers to the sequence of nucleotides that actually codes for a [[protein]] and is read by the [[Ribosome]]. Any mutations in the reading frame can cause a change in protein structure

## Point Mutations
Usually a change in 1 to 3 nucleotides and only effect one [[gene]].

Occur during [[DNA]] synthesis in the cell cycle.
### Substitution Mutations
A type of point mutation where the original nucleotide is replace by a different nucleotide.

Can be silent meaning that the mutation doesn't change anything in the phenotype.

### Missense Mutation
A change in a single nucleotide results in a change in a single amino acid in the sequence

Possibilities:
- [[protein]] doesn't work
- Decreased functionality of the [[protein]]
- Increased functionality of the [[protein]]

### Nonsense Mutation
A change in a single nucleotide that results in a premature stop codon in the m[[RNA]] sequence.

### Frameshift Mutation
A type of mutation where addition or removal of a single nucleotide changes the reading frame for the [[protein]]. Always has a negative effect.

### Insertion Mutation
Insertion of a single nucleotide into the [[DNA]] sequence
Insertions change the reading frame which also change the entire amino acid sequence after the insertion.
[[protein]] will not fold correctly.

### Deletion Mutation 
The day I need notes for this mutation is the day of my death.

## Chromosomal Mutations
Mutations that effect big sections of [[chromosome]]s and effect many [[gene]].

Occur during [[meiosis]].
